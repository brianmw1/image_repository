Just some notes to keep track of my decisions.
Python
    -Due to previous experience with the language.
Flask
    -Minimal framework to create a web app. Django seemed to complex to learn quickly. A CLI app did not seem sufficient.
sqlite3 db
    -sqlite3 is simple for a small project plus it allows me to locally store the db file. Anything else is too complex for this project's scope.
    -images table
        -title
        -description
        -image
        -user/owner
    -user table
        -login
        -hashed password
